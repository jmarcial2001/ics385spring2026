This is the main page for Course ICS 385 Spring 2026.

## Week 1 - Introduction, AI and Setup



## Week 2 - HTML and CSS
#### - HW2: Bio Page - [index.html](week2/hw2/index.html), [stylesheet.css](week2/hw2/stylesheet.css)



## Week 3 - JavaScript

#### - HW 2: Simon Game - [index.html](week3/hw2/index.html), [styles.css](week3/hw2/styles.css), [game.js](week3/hw2/game.js)



## Week 4 - NodeJS
#### - HW 1: hero-hw4 - [app.js](week4/hero-hw4/app.js)
Extends the in-class hero Node.js example by using five npm packages to generate content and save the results to text files.
1. superheroes - [hero.txt](week4/hero-hw4/output/hero.txt)
2. supervillains - [villain.txt](week4/hero-hw4/output/villain.txt)
3. inspirational-quotes - [inspiration-quote.txt](week4/hero-hw4/output/inspiration-quote.txt)
4. popular-movie-quotes - [popular-movie-quotes.txt](week4/hero-hw4/output/popular-movie-quotes.txt)
5. famous-last-words - [famous-last-words.txt](week4/hero-hw4/output/famous-last-words.txt)

#### - HW 2: QR Code
  Functions:
    normalizeUrl(input)
    isValidUrl(url)
    makeSafeFilename(name)
    buildDefaultBaseName(url)
    ensureOutputDir()
    resolveNonOverwritePath(path)
    appendHistory(entry)


Improved the QR generator by validating URLs, fixing missing https, letting users pick PNG or SVG, saving output in an organized folder, preventing   overwrites, logging history, and showing a safety reminder. This project started from the Udemy QR Code Generator (Section 23.199). The original code asks the user for a URL, generates a QR image, and saves the URL into a text file. My manager asked me to make this code easier to use and safer.

The user enters the radius and height, and the application calculates the volume using: Volume = π × r² × h
